This Repository is for Dr. Perkins's CS 3377 Unix class project 6.
My name is Tennessee Bonner.
My UTD email is TCB150030@utdallas.edu
The date is April 23, 2018

This program contains the following files
-README.md
-project6.cc
-project6.h
-Makefile 
-cs3377.bin

The program reads from the binary file and stores the data from it in a GUI in Unix
called CDK. This GUI remains on screen until the user pushes another button

To run this file:
-Initialize make by typing "make" into the command line
-type in "./project6"
-this will display the GUI
-Press a button to clear the GUI from the screen
